Complete Home Server Setup Guide using minimal system requirements and cost effective method of Cloud storage. 



 1)Installing TrueNAS SCALE:
 
• Step 1: Prepare Installation Media

         Download TrueNAS SCALE ISO from the official site:  https://www.truenas.com/download-truenas-scale/                                                   
         Use Rufus or Balena Etcher to flash the ISO to a USB drive.
         Plug this USB into your PC/server where you’ll host TrueNAS.

• Step 2: Boot and Install

          Boot from the USB installer.
          Choose Install/Upgrade TrueNAS SCALE.
          Select the HDD you want to install the OS on.(Warning: This will erase everything on that drive.)
          Set a root password when prompted.
          Wait for installation to complete, then reboot (remove USB).

• Step 3: Access the Web Dashboard

          After reboot, the console screen shows a local IP like:    http://192.168.x.xx
          From another device on the same LAN, open a browser and visit that IP.
                                         -> Log in with: Username: root
                                                       Password: (the one you set)




2)Creating a Data Pool
•  Step 1: Open Storage → Pools

      Click Create Pool.
      Give it a name (e.g., NAS_Storage).
      Select your unused HDD from available disks.

•  Step 2: Choose Layout


        Stripe: No redundancy (just one disk, all space usable)
        Mirror: Redundancy (two disks, same data)
        RAIDZ: For multiple drives and redundancy

         Click Create → Confirm.

3)Creating a Dataset
•  Step 1: Inside Your Pool → Add Dataset

Go to Storage → Pools → NAS_Storage → Add Dataset.
Name it (e.g., NextcloudData or PersonalFiles).
Keep defaults unless you want to:
Set Share Type: SMB
Adjust Compression (LZ4 is fine)
Click Save.

4)Creating an SMB Share (Windows & LAN Access)
•  Step 1: Create the Share

Go to Sharing → Windows Shares (SMB).
Click Add.
Choose Path: Browse and select your dataset (e.g., /mnt/NAS_Storage/NextcloudData).
Name it (e.g., NAS_Share).
Enable “Allow guest access” (optional for testing).
Click Save → Enable the SMB Service when prompted.

•  Step 2: Set Permissions

Go to Storage → Pools → NextcloudData → Edit Permissions.
Choose User: root or create a new user for access.
Check “Apply User and Group recursively”.
Save.

 5)Accessing the NAS Storage via LAN
•  From Windows Laptop:

Open File Explorer → This PC → Map Network Drive.
Choose a letter (e.g., Z:).
Enter:       \\192.168.1x.xx\savedlocation
Enter username/password if required.
You can now read/write files directly as if it’s a local drive.



6)Installing Nextcloud on TrueNAS SCALE
•  Step 1: Go to Apps → Discover

Search for Nextcloud.
Click Install.

•  Step 2: Configure Nextcloud App

Application Name: nextcloud
Storage Settings: Choose your dataset (/mnt/NAS_Storage/NextcloudData) as data directory
Networking: Set the app to run on a static IP (e.g., 192.168.x.xx) or leave as default dynamic IP.   
(But Static network is something provided by a network provider like Airtel etc... you can buy these by contacting them.)
User/Password: Enter Nextcloud admin credentials.
Deploy App → Wait for it to start.

•  Step 3: Access Nextcloud

Once deployed, TrueNAS will show a URL like: http://192.168.x.xx
Open it in a browser → log in with your Nextcloud credentials.



7) Accessing Nextcloud Across Multiple Devices
 • From PC:

Open browser → http://192.168.x.x
Log in to view, upload, or manage files.

•  From Mobile:

Install Nextcloud App from Play Store / App Store.
Enter: http://192.168.x.xx

 Log in with same credentials.
